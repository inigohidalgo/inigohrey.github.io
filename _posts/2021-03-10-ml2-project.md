## Introduction

This is an assignment I carried out for my Machine Learning 2 course. The objective of the analysis was to predict day-ahead power prices in Spain given various forecasts available the day before.

The notebook containing all the code can be found [here](https://github.com/inigohidalgo/data-science-projects/blob/main/machine-learning/ML2_assignment.ipynb).

### Dataset Information

Our dataset contained the following variables:

* `date`: date of the observation `%Y-%m-%d`
* `hour`: hour of the observation, `[0 - 23]`
* `fc_demand`: forecast of demand in MWh
* `fc_nuclear`: forecast of nuclear power production in MWh
* `import_FR`: forecast of the importing capacity from France to Spain in MWh
* `export_FR`: forecast of the exporting capacity from Spain to France in MWh
* `fc_wind`: forecast of wind power production in MWh
* `fc_solar_pv`: forecast of PV solar (solar panels) power production in MWh
* `fc_solar_th`: forecast of thermal solar power production in MWh
* **`price`**: power price for each hour in â‚¬/MWh. This is the target variable to predict.

It contained 32135 hourly obsevations spanning 2 years. 

## Initial EDA

### Missing Values

We found 13 missing values in `import_FR` and `export_FR`.


<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ml2-project/missing_matrix.png" alt="missing_matrix" style="width:75%">

As we can see from this matrix, the values are missing at the same time for both variables.

In order to check whether the "missingness" of these variables was correlated with other variables in our dataset I generated variables which took a value of 1 if each variable was missing, and then plotted a correlation matrix with these two new variables.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ml2-project/missing_corr_matrix.png" alt="missing_corr_matrix">

We can see there is not a significant correlation between the "missingness" and other variables, so I decided to impute these values using sklearn's [`KNNImputer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.KNNImputer.html) in the [Feature Engineering](#feature-engineering) section.


### Time Series Visualizations

Energy prices are highly dependent on human behavior, which is largely driven by the weather, sun and the seasons. In order to analyze this I generated boxplots averaging the variables for each hour of the day and for each month. Here I reproduce the most interesting ones.

#### Demand

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ml2-project/fc_demand_ts_summary.png" alt="fc_demand_ts_summary">

* Intradaily we can see a clear trend in demand for energy which correlates with times when people are either at work or awake at home using electricity.
* Monthly we can see the highest demand is in the winter months and in July, to power either heating or ACs.

#### Wind Production

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ml2-project/fc_wind_ts_summary.png" alt="fc_wind_ts_summary">

There is much lower wind production in the warmer months and during the midday hours.

#### Solar Production

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ml2-project/fc_solar_th_ts_summary.png" alt="fc_solar_th_ts_summary">

#### Price

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ml2-project/price_ts_summary.png" alt="price_ts_summary">

We can see similar trends to those found in [demand](#demand) though less marked.

## Feature Engineering

### Date Features

As we've seen, energy demand and thus price are highly correlated with the season and time of day. In order to feed this information into the models I created the following variables using a custom transformer class in order to feed it into sklearn `Pipeline`s:

* `season`, which can be returned as a column of strings or as a series of encoded columns
* `is_holiday`, whether or not it is a holiday in Spain
* `is_weekend`
* `is_business_day`, the combination of the two previous features
* `sunlight`, hours of sunlight
* `sun`, whether or not the sun is up at any given hour (rounds to the nearest hour)
* `t_from_zenith`, the hours away from the sun's zenith
* `day_period`, the period of the day, whether it is early morning, midday, evening or night.

In this chart we can see the progression of *demand* throughout the day according to whether or not it is a business day.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ml2-project/fc_demand_busday.png" alt="fc_demand_busday">

Clearly a lot more energy is consumed on business days. This difference becomes pronounced at around 7-8 am and continues on throughout the day.

This chart shows the *average price* of electricity for every hour in our dataset, split by whether or not it was a business day in Spain.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ml2-project/price_busday.png" alt="price_busday">

* We can see that it is higher on average during business days, with a stronger upward trend from 6 to 10am, with non-business days only catching up late in the evening.
* It follows a similar pattern to demand, though the difference between business and non- business days is not as pronounced.


### Energy Features

The other main factor which influences energy prices is the difference between supply and demand. In order to model this we calculated various variables:

* **Thermal gap** (`dif_demand_total`): a big influence on energy prices is how much energy will need to be generated using expensive coal. We do not have this data available but it can be estimated by subtracting the total forecast renewable power production from the forecast demand.
* We also generated differences and ratios between demand and all the individual types of power production.

Similarly to our earlier [time series visualizations](#time-series-visualizations), here we plot the hourly and monthly average thermal gap in our dataset.

<figure class="half">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ml2-project/thermal_gap_hourly.png" alt="thermal_gap_hourly" style="width:50%"/>
    <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ml2-project/thermal_gap_monthly.png" alt="thermal_gap_monthly" style="width:50%"/>
</figure>



There is a very clear variability in the thermal gap:
* On a yearly scale, there is a big drop around March and April, and peaks around January and July.
* On a daily sale, and similarly to demand and price, the thermal gap increases throughout the morning and rises even further in the evening.

### Feature Selection

Once the new features were generated, I wanted to see how they correlated with the target variable (and with each other). Below you can see a correlation matrix.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ml2-project/feateng_corplot.png" alt="feateng_corplot" class="full">

We can see the strongest linear correlations to price are the thermal gap (`dif_fc_demand_total`), the difference between demand and wind production (`dif_fc_demand_fc_wind`) and solar production (`dif_fc_demand_fc_solar_pv`).

Of the seasons, spring has the strongest relationship, with a negative correlation with price.

Below are the variables which have the highest mutual information with price:

| Variable                  | Mutual Information |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| sunlight_s                | 0.546832           |
| import_FR                 | 0.455487           |
| export_FR                 | 0.430085           |
| dif_fc_demand_total       | 0.387599           |
| fc_nuclear                | 0.346977           |
| dif_fc_demand_fc_wind     | 0.308143           |
| dif_fc_demand_fc_solar_pv | 0.202925           |
| fc_wind/fc_demand         | 0.199281           |
| dif_fc_demand_fc_solar_th | 0.173173           |
| dif_fc_demand_fc_nuclear  | 0.168788           |
| fc_demand                 | 0.167784           |
| fc_nuclear/fc_demand      | 0.156815           |
| fc_wind                   | 0.122667           |
| season_spring             | 0.117398           |
| season_summer             | 0.102191           |

`sunlight_s` which did not have a strong correlation with price on the other hand has a really high mutual information score, similarly to `import_FR` and `export_FR`.

## Machine Learning

### Model Testing

In order to get a baseline performance I performed a linear regression including only the numeric variables, without the generated features. Below you can see its performance:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ml2-project/rmse_simple_lrreg.png" alt="rmse_simple_lrreg">

Using an untuned XGBoost yields the following result:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ml2-project/xgb_untuned_rmse.png" alt="xgb_untuned_rmse">

After using XGBoost's early stopping functionality we attain the following score:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ml2-project/xgb_early_stopping_rmse.png" alt="xgb_early_stopping_rmse">

The early-stopping attained the lowest RMSE with around 100 rounds, but this was using a single train-test split. The following graph shows the cross-validated scores for increasing numbers of trees.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ml2-project/val_curve_n_estimators_xgb.png" alt="val_curve_n_estimators_xgb">

When cross-tuning `max_depth` and `min_child_weight` through cross-validation, the best parameters were a maximum depth of 2 and a minimum weight of 1. A maximum depth of 2 indicates the untuned model was possibly overfitting the data. The tuned model's performance on the test set was:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ml2-project/rmse_tuned_xgb.png" alt="rmse_tuned_xgb">

Despite the RMSE being worse, I used this model to make the final predictions on the test set we were evaluated on since it was likely overfitting the data less. The model's final RMSE on the unseen test set was 12.54, lower than on the test set.

## Conclusion

In the table below we can see the variables that XGBoost considers the most important when predicting prices.

|                   feature | importance |
| ------------------------: | ---------- |
|       dif_fc_demand_total | 0.289553   |
|             season_spring | 0.107948   |
|     fc_solar_pv/fc_demand | 0.098035   |
| dif_fc_demand_fc_solar_pv | 0.080524   |
|     dif_fc_demand_fc_wind | 0.074482   |
|             season_autumn | 0.068868   |
|                sunlight_s | 0.065301   |
|               fc_solar_pv | 0.064575   |
|                 import_FR | 0.050853   |
|           total/fc_demand | 0.038826   |
|                fc_nuclear | 0.032017   |
|                 export_FR | 0.018286   |
|               fc_solar_th | 0.010731   |

* Thermal gap is at the top. Clearly the cost of coal production is a big driver of energy prices in Spain.
* Spring and autumn are important seasons determining energy prices.
* The amount of sunlight is also an important factor driving demand for energy.

These are the predictions on the final evaluation set:
